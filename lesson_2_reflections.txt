- Initializing a new repository will add a folder that collects all the meta 
data off the repository. With this meta data the different version of a file can
be tracked.

- The staging area only contains files you want to keep track off and it offers a place
where files can be collected before they are commited.

- By only adding the file that belong to one logical change and before commiting 
checking the difference between those files and the last commit or current files.

- By using branches you can make changes to a program that may break it and keep the
original file at the same time. This makes is easier to experiment.

- By drawing the branches the structure will be easier understandable and it is clear
in one view how the branches are connected to eachother.

- When merging two branches together, we add the functionality from the one branch to
the other. Branches are parralel to the master branch.

- Automatic merging is nice since you don't have to do anything. But at the same thing
you let lose of the controls and don't know what is happening.
