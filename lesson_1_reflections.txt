- By using the diff command, files can be compaired easily. When a bug occures after a
change is made to a file, the difference will tell why it is not working no more.

- When having the ability to access the history of a file, older better working parts of 
the file can be found more easily and can help improve the current file.

- The pros are that you can choose when to commit, so more often when this is needed. 
The cons are that the chance is bigger that you forget to commit.

- Because code files have a lot more interconnection with eachother while documents 
are often more seperated from eachother.

- The log command will print the history of commits and with the diff command the 
version of a file can be compaired.

- By knowing that you can restore older working version is it less of a problem to break
a file/code.

- I want to use Git for some simple code that I made in my Arduino projects to learn how
it is working and to keep control of different versions.
